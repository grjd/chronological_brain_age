# Abstract #
Normal aging is associated with changes in volumetric indices of brain atrophy. A quantitative understanding of age-related brain changes can shed light on successful aging. To investigate the effect of age on global and regional brain volumes and cortical surface and thickness, 3,514 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed using automated brain segmentation and parcellation methods in elderly healthy individuals (69-88 years of age). 
Machine learning models to predict the chronological age were built, followed by the relative importance of features when making an age prediction.
The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm achieved a mean absolute error of 2 years in predicting the age of new subjects.
Feature importance analysis showed that the brain to intracranial volume ratio is the most important feature to predict age, followed by the hippocampi volumes. Additionally, the cortical thickness in temporal and parietal lobes showed superior predictive value than frontal and occipital lobes. 
Insights from this approach that integrates model prediction and interpretation may help shorten the current explanatory gap between chronological age and biological brain age.
